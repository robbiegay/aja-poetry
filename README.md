# Aja Leachman Poetry Website

I made this site for my friend Aja, as a place for her to share her poetry and faith-based writings. 
Aja is a teacher and writer from Frankfort, KY who currently lives in Louisville.

## Project History

**April 11th, 2020 — Saturday:**
I promised Aja I would build her a website months ago. Unfortunately, as I have continued my freelance work and job hunt, this has been something I have repeatedly put off. I finally created the design files (1.5 hours) a few weeks ago, but it wasn't until today — with a free Saturday evening — that I finally sat down to build her site. I spent about an hour doing some research on how to build the CRUD features for Aja to use, and have been building the basic site from 9:15 pm–2:45 am. I finished core functionality around 1:30 am, and spent the remainder of the night trying to get React Router to work.

**April 12th, 2020 — Sunday:**
On Sunday, I did more trouble shooting on React Router from Noon-2 pm. I eventually settled on a solution of using HashRouter to navigate between pages.

**Project Timesheet:**
- Design: 1.5 hours (March 2020)
- Basic Website: 8.5 hours
- Login and CRUD for poems: -Coming Soon-

**Total: 10 hours**
