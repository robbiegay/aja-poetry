                She’s calling again<br />
                You do not move to silence it<br />
                and<br />
                we don’t pretend not to<br />
                hear the buzzing of the cupholder.<br />
                <br />

                Instead<br />
                with each ring<br />
                you and I let her feel this moment<br />
                like watching<br />
                like she can see us.<br />
                <br />

                When she calls<br />
                we pause in our kisses<br />
                our talking<br />
                you hold “I want you”<br />
                on the tip of your tongue<br />
                until the buzzing stops —<br />
                <br />

                we let her worrying<br />
                rest in the centimeters between<br />
                our chest.<br />
                <br />

                She calls again.<br />
                <br />

                Hard not to laugh this time<br />
                probably imagining you<br />
                rolling around<br />
                in another woman’s bed.<br />
                <br />

                You aren’t.<br />
                It’s 2am<br />
                she knows you are not sleep,<br />
                <br />

                yet,<br />
                <br />

                would she guess us<br />
                sharing the same seat<br />
                as the warm air<br />
                Leaks out the sunroof you opened<br />
                so I could see the stars?<br />
                Would she guess<br />
                “What do we do now?”<br />
                Escaped your lips<br />
                her smile lit up<br />
                Bright &amp;<br />
                buzzing<br />
                across your screen?<br />
                <br />

                <em>There is no we —</em><br />
                <em>you and I can own nothing together</em><br />
                <em>more than this moment</em><br />
                &nbsp;	&nbsp;	&nbsp;	&nbsp;I stick my hand in your shirt to warm my fingers<br />
                <em>nothing will be ours</em><br />
                <br />

                “Maybe in another lifetime, huh?”<br />
                <em>Baby, we only have this one</em><br />
                <br />
                <br />
                <br />
                <br />
            </p>
