                Molded to harden, kilned<br />
                to crack. She was cracking<br />
                eggs over burnt skillets<br />
                scrambling for home cooked hearts<br />
                southern-fried, made with love<br />
                hollow egg like cheap vases<br />
                Black porcelain —<br />
                Have you ever seen it?<br />
                <br />
                
                Full belly of Momma knows best<br />
                She pushes the chair back from her glass table <br />
                head hits wooden ceiling,<br />
                grown too big for ya sorroundins, huh?<br />
                <br />

                Crouch toward sculpting fingers  <br />
                to whisk her hips still wrapped with clay.<br />
                “know me?” spins on the easel <br />
                “Know me?” drips down her check<br />
                Black porcelain, have you ever seen it?<br />
                <br />

                She thought there would be twirling <br />
                there was only spinning <br />
                dizziness in reshaping, heat —<br />
                like eggs scrambled in hot oil<br />
                this ain’t homecooked baby <br />
                “a hard head makes a soft behind.” <br />
                Black Porcelain, have you ever seen it?<br />
                <br />
                <br />
                <br />
